      <description>On Unix there is a syslog service that handles centralized logging. Using it for logging from your daemons has the advantage of putting control of the logging options in the hands of the system administrator, without involving you, the developer. If they want certain log rotations, or there is a preferred directory, or if the logs are sent over the network to a central logging server, it has nothing to do with you, as long as you are logging to syslog.</description>

      <description>I was working with a friend on debugging an odd pickling issue. In order to really play with it, we started a Python interpreter and ran through the list of imports and sys.path.appends necessary to set up active database and memcache connections, as well as load the project code.
My friend mentioned that he had a python session on his desktop that he never dared to close, since the setup had been so much trouble.</description>
