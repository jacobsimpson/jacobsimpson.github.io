# A Basic Lua Plugin

Clone and own a [working
example](https://github.com/jacobsimpson/nvim-example-lua-plugin).

TODO: There have been a lot of Neovim improvements, this example could probably
use some  updates. Also, if the `luamodule` was named `myluamodule` it would be
just a little more obvious that the directory name/module name can be changed.

TODO: Make a bash script that downloads and renames everything, so that you can
run one of those fancy curl commands and have a working plugin in a moment.
