# Building Neovim Plugins in Lua

## First

To acknowledge, all this information is available somewhere, most of it in the
Neovim `:help` documentation. I just find it easier to pull it all together.
I'm not a proficient plugin writer, and when I do write a plugin, I'm just
trying to quickly solve a problem and get back to work. I want a place to see
examples and copy working code.

I don't really enjoy working in VimScript, so this is as much about Lua as
possible. However, at heart, I am a pragmatist, so where it makes sense, I put
things in VimScript. `autocmd`, key mappings, commands and the like. I don't
cover how to do any of that stuff in much depth here, there are much better
resources available.
